Compare two arrays in "length-constant" time. This thwarts timing-based
attacks by guaranteeing all comparisons (of a given length) take the same
amount of time.

See the section "Why does the hashing code on this page compare the hashes in
"length-constant" time?" at:

bool lengthConstantEquals(ubyte[] a, ubyte[] b)
{
	auto diff = a.length ^ b.length;
	for(int i = 0; i < a.length && i < b.length; i++)
		diff |= a[i] ^ b[i];

	return diff == 0;
}
